  <h1>The OpenCV Foundation</h1>
  <p>
    The OpenCV Foundation is a registered non-profit organization that
    seeks to improve computer vision. It is also the legal organism
    behind the <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> library. Our official
    statement of purpose is:
  </p>
  <div style="width:400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
    <i>To advance all aspects of machine and computer vision:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>develop and improve algorithms</i></li>
      <li><i>educate practitioners and users</i></li>
      <li><i>increase the number of uses and users</i></li>
      <li><i>enable free and/or commercial deployment of computer
             vision applications in all areas while providing an industrial
             quality open and free infrastructure to help achieve these
             goals.</i></li>

  <h1>What we do</h1>
  <p>
    We believe a good software basis is key to improving computer vision. The OpenCV foundation makes sure the OpenCV library remains close to its users by:
    <ul>
      <li>managing the GSOC (3 years already ! 2011, 2012, 2013)</li>
      <li>organizing workshops (like for CVPR 2013)</li>
      <li>sponsoring students (like)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>How we do it</h1>
  <p>
    With extreme motivation ! Computer vision is cool !
  </p>
  <p>
    We also have <a href="http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/Meeting_notes"> weekly meetings</a> during which we brainstorm and decide the future os computer vision software. Oh, and if you come to a vision conference, try to grab one of <a href="./people.html">us</a>, we'de be happy to get any help or feedback.
  </p>
<!--  <p>
    We keep track of what we do in our <a href="./reports.html">reports</a>

  <h1>Wanna help ?</h1>
  <p>
    Well, there are actually many many ways you could help computer vision software, that's why we wrote a <a href="./getinvolved.html">whole page</a>
